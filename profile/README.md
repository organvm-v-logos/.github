## What Is ORGAN-V?

ORGAN-V is the public-facing process layer of the [organvm system](https://github.com/meta-organvm) — an eight-organ creative-institutional architecture spanning theory, art, commerce, orchestration, community, marketing, and meta-governance.

Where other organs *produce* artifacts, ORGAN-V produces **the account of how those artifacts came to be**. It is the organ of narration, reflection, and methodological transparency. Its outputs are essays, process documentation, marginalia, and the ongoing public record of what it means to build a multi-organ creative system from first principles.

The name comes from the Greek *λόγος* (logos) — a word that resists clean translation. It means *word*, *speech*, *reason*, *account*, *explanation*, *ratio*, *principle*. That semantic breadth is deliberate. ORGAN-V is where the system explains itself — not as marketing copy (that belongs to [ORGAN-VII](https://github.com/organvm-vii-kerygma)), but as honest, substantive reflection on process, failure, and methodology.

## Why Build in Public?

Most creative and technical work is presented as a finished product. The drafts, dead ends, architectural pivots, and reasoning chains that produced it are discarded or hidden. ORGAN-V inverts this default.

Building in public matters because:

- **Process is product.** The decisions behind a system are often more instructive than the system itself. A well-documented pivot teaches more than a polished landing page.
- **Transparency invites accountability.** Publishing methodology means it can be scrutinized, challenged, and improved by others.
- **The gap between intent and execution is where learning lives.** Essays that track that gap — honestly, in real time — create a record that has long-term value for both the author and the audience.
- **Writing clarifies thinking.** The act of articulating a decision forces precision that internal notes never demand. ORGAN-V essays are a forcing function for the entire system's intellectual rigor.

This is not performative openness. ORGAN-V publishes because the process of building an eight-organ system across 81 repositories is itself a body of knowledge worth preserving.

The `public-process` repository is the primary venue for ORGAN-V content. It houses 40 long-form essays (2,000-5,000 words each, ~130K words total), organized by category (meta-system, case study, retrospective, guide). Its Jekyll site with RSS is live at **[organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process](https://organvm-v-logos.github.io/public-process/)**. The four supporting repos provide autonomous essay pipeline automation (`essay-pipeline`), privacy-first engagement analytics (`analytics-engine`), editorial governance (`editorial-standards`), and curated intellectual context (`reading-observatory`).

## How ORGAN-V Fits the System

The organvm system distributes creative and institutional work across eight specialized organs — 81 repositories, ~320K words of documentation. ORGAN-V occupies a unique position: it is the organ that **observes and narrates** the work of all the others.

| Organ | Domain | Greek | Organization |
|:-----:|:-------|:------|:-------------|
| I | Theory | *theoria* | [organvm-i-theoria](https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria) |
| II | Art | *poiesis* | [organvm-ii-poiesis](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis) |
| III | Commerce | *ergon* | [organvm-iii-ergon](https://github.com/organvm-iii-ergon) |
| IV | Orchestration | *taxis* | [organvm-iv-taxis](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis) |
| **V** | **Public Process** | ***logos*** | **[organvm-v-logos](https://github.com/organvm-v-logos)** |
| VI | Community | *koinonia* | [organvm-vi-koinonia](https://github.com/organvm-vi-koinonia) |
| VII | Marketing | *kerygma* | [organvm-vii-kerygma](https://github.com/organvm-vii-kerygma) |
| VIII | Meta | — | [meta-organvm](https://github.com/meta-organvm) |

ORGAN-V draws on ORGAN-I (theory) for conceptual frameworks, works alongside ORGAN-VI (community) for audience engagement, and feeds ORGAN-VII (marketing) with narratives that can be adapted for distribution. But its primary dependency is the system itself: every organ generates the material that ORGAN-V reflects upon.
